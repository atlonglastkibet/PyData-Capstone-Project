# MPOX OUTBREAK EDA: EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS

## Project Overview

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Mpox outbreak that occurred between 2022 and 2023 in Europe and the Americas. The analysis aims to uncover epidemiological patterns, demographic impacts, and regional differences in the spread and control of the disease.

## Objectives
- Analyze mpox outbreak epidemiological patterns to Identify trends in case numbers, case fatality rates.
- Compare outbreak dynamics in the most affected geographic and demographic groups.
- Assess public health responses & interventions between Europe and Americas.


## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes data from reputable public health organizations:
- **Kaggle:**.[Mpox dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/utkarshx27/mpox-monkeypox-dataset-analysis)
- **Our World in Data:** Edouard Mathieu, Fiona Spooner, Saloni Dattani, Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2022) - “Mpox” Published online at OurWorldinData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/mpox' [Online Resource]
